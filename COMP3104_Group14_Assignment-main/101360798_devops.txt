Title: COMP3104 â€“ DevOps (Course Summary)
Date: 2025-10-06

What DevOps Means (student version) :
DevOps = dev + ops working together, with automation, so changes ship faster and safer. The key idea is *small changes + constant feedback*.

## Tools We Used/Discussed
- **Git & GitHub** for version control and Pull Requests
- **GitHub Actions** for CI (runs on every push/PR)
- **Docker** concept for consistent environments (even if basic)
